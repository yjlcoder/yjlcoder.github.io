# Biography
I took my undergrad program at Tongji University. After graduation, I worked on the research of Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Large-scale data transmission routing with Yale University, Caltech University, and CERN. Now I'm an M.Sc student at the University of Calgary, supervised by Dr. Mea Wang. My focus is on Multimedia Streaming and Video codecs. I'm looking for extending my research interest to Machine Learning and Virtualization as well.
